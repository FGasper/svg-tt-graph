=head1 NAME

Task::SDK::V1 - Version 1 of Task::SDK

=head1 WARNING

This is not a finalised list, please do not rely
on this version yet.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Task::SDK aims to provide a Standard Development/Deployment Kit
for Perl. Specificially with the aim of creating a stable learning
environment.

The latest stable version will always be pointed to
from Task::SDK, however for backwards compatibility there
will also be specific versions always available on CPAN. 

The modules listed as dependencies of this package are there
to suggest a single way of doing a specific task. CPAN and Perl
offer many ways to do things, and this can be a great advantage,
but this is often confusing and overwhelming for someone just
starting with CPAN. Therefore we are recommending a specific
set of modules for a new user to start learning from / deploying with.
